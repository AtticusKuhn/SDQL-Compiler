- The implementation of `concat` in Rust is ugly, need to fix it.
- `sub` currently type `t -> t -> t`, should introduce a typeclass for it.
- `if _ then _` with no else branch (uses default value in else branch).
- need to implement `<` (less than comparison)
- Parser requires space around `date (1000)`, need to fix this.
- refactor `untyped.lean` to not be 1000 lines long (this is too long).
- Get github workflow to run successfully.
